# CalisphAir-LFLV-2023
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the data analysis and data visualization behind the Calisph'Air 2023 project (initiated by CNES). We used Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot and analyse de data that we collected throughout the year. 

The vast majority of the repository is in French, except for the code (duh).
